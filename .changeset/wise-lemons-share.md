Add `defineCodeBlockShiki` for code block highlighting using `shiki` v1, providing a solid default for syntax highlighting.

Expose all supported languages and themes accessible through `shikiBundledLanguages` and `shikiBundledThemes`.

Remove `defineCodeBlockShikiji` as `shikiji` is merged back to `shiki`.
