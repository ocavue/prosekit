Added `defineCodeBlockShiki` for code block highlighting using `shiki` v1, providing a solid default for syntax highlighting.

Exported all `shiki` supported languages and themes via `shikiBundledLanguagesInfo` and `shikiBundledThemesInfo`.

Removed `defineCodeBlockShikiji` because `shikiji` is merged back to `shiki`.
