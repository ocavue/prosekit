# Introduction

**Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps.**

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

## FAQ

::: details Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?

The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. The design of your components should be separate from their implementation.

:::

::: details Which frameworks are supported?

You can use **React**, **Vue**, **Preact**, **Svelte** and **Solid**. If you found a component that you need, but it's not supported in your framework, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ocavue/prosekit/issues/new).

::: details Can I use this in my project?

Yes. Free to use for personal and commercial projects. No attribution required.

But hey, let me know if you do. I'd love to see what you build.
